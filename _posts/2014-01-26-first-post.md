After a year or so of neglect, I finally decided to rebuild my own web site.
This time around, the new design is more "blog"-centric. To generate this
website, I choose to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and ditch Tumblr. I
will slowly migrate some of my old blog posts from Tumblr to here.

I think Tumblr was a great platform, but I was getting tired of using the web
based editor. Every time I used the web editor, I felt so foregin and
cumbersome.  My editor of choice, of course, is [Vim](http://www.vim.org). Using
a static site generator like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), I can use my
favourite editor, and markdown to create my posts. The look and feel of the blog
is consistent to rest of the site as well.
