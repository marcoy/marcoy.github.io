= Some Updates
:page-layout: post

I have been on hiatus for more than two years now.
So I have decided to update the site's layout and add some new content.
Since the past two years, a lot have changes.
I have a different job, and I get even more into functional programming.
In addition to Clojure, I get into Haskell, and recently Scala.
