== What is ArangoDB

== Topics
 - Two API calls for vertex and edge.
   * `createDocuemnt` vs `graphCreateVertex`
   * `createEdge` vs `graphCreateEdge`

The the API calls, `createEdge` does not do validation, but `graphCreateEdge` does.
No idea what `graphCreateVertex` does differently from `createDocument` <- **NEED to exlpore further**.

Batching helps.
The `setBatchSize()` in `ArangoConfig` has nothing to do with execution batching.

== Benchmark Setup
50K nodes and an edge in between all nodes, so 49999 edges.
