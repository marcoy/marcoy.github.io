My name is Marco Yuen. I am a software developer in New York City, and I have been living
in the city for more than five years.
Originally, I am from west coast Canada.
My interests are functional programming, type systems, concurrency, and distributed systems.
When I am not in front of a computer, I do Crossfit and watch Rugby.
